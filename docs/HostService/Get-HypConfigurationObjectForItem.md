# Get-Hypconfigurationobjectforitem
Retrieves the configuration data for an item in the Host Service provider path.  Note: For this release, only VM items are supported for this operation.
## Syntax
```
Get-HypConfigurationObjectForItem [-LiteralPath] <String> [-BearerToken <String>] [-VirtualSiteId <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
This command provides a mechanism for retrieving extra data about an entry in the hosting unit service provider.  The referenced item must be contained within the connections directory in the provider (i.e. XDHyp:\\Connections).

This mechanism is used for obtaining data that is not required frequently and/or has a high overhead associated with its retrieval (so as to maintain the responsiveness of the provider). For this release of the PowerShell snap-in the only provider items that can be used with this operation are VM items.  For a VM this provides a mechanism to obtain the number of CPUs, the amount of Memory (in MB) and hard disk drive capacity (GB).
