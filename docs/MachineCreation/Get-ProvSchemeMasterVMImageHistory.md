# Get-Provschememastervmimagehistory
Gets the list of master VM snapshots that have been used to provide hard disks to provisioning schemes.
## Syntax
```
Get-ProvSchemeMasterVMImageHistory [-ProvisioningSchemeName <String>] [-ProvisioningSchemeUid <Guid>] [-MasterImageVM <String>] [-VMImageHistoryUid <Guid>] [-ImageStatus <String>] [-ShowAll] [-ReturnTotalRecordCount] [-MaxRecordCount <Int32>] [-Skip <Int32>] [-SortBy <String>] [-Filter <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to discover the master VM snapshots used to provide the hard disk image for provisioning schemes.  This information includes the date and time when the image was introduced.

By default, this cmdlet returns only those snapshots that have been used previously.  This information can be used to roll back a provisioning scheme to a previous image.

The ShowAll parameter may be supplied to also show the snapshot for the image currently in use, and the snapshots for any images prepared for later use.
