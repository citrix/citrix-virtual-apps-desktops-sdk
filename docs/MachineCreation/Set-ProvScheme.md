## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme to be updated. | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolName | The name of an identity pool to associate with the provisioning scheme, replacing the present one. | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | The identifier of an identity pool to associate with the provisioning scheme, replacing the present one. | true | false |  |
| ProvisioningSchemeUid | The identifier of the provisioning scheme to be updated. | true | false |  |
| VMCpuCount | The number of processors that virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme should use. | false | false |  |
| VMMemoryMB | The maximum amount of memory that virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme should use. | false | false |  |
| CustomProperties | The properties of the provisioning scheme that are specific to the target hosting infrastructure. | false | false |  |
| ServiceOffering | The name of the cloud service offering to use when creating machines. | false | false |  |
| PassThru | Returns the affected record. By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output. | false | false | False |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
