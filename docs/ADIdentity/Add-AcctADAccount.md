# Add-Acctadaccount
Import Active Directory computer accounts from Active Directory for use in the AD Identity Service.
## Syntax
```
Add-AcctADAccount [-IdentityPoolName] <String> -ADAccountName <String[]> [-Password <String>] [-SecurePassword <SecureString>] [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AcctADAccount -IdentityPoolUid <Guid> -ADAccountName <String[]> [-Password <String>] [-SecurePassword <SecureString>] [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Provides the ability for Active Directory computer accounts that already exist in Active Directory to be used by the Citrix AD Identity Service and the other Citrix Machine Creation Services.

All aspects of this command that need to make modifications to the accounts in Active Directory will do so using the account that the PowerShell runspace is using.  This means that if the passwords need resetting for the accounts, the user performing the operation in PowerShell must have sufficient privileges in Active Directory for this operation to complete successfully.

The following rules apply to the importing of Active Directory accounts; If the current account password is supplied, the cmdlet will attempt to change the password so that it is known only to the Citrix Identity Service.  This uses password change operations and does not need AD account administration permissions. If the current password is not supplied, the cmdlet will attempt to reset the password for the Active Directory account so that it is known only to the Citrix Identity Service. This requires the cmdlet to have enough privileges in Active Directory for the accounts' password reset to be available. Imported accounts in a disabled or locked state in Active Directory are imported with the account marked in an error state. If the identity pool into which the account is being imported does not have a domain set, it assumes the domain of the first account imported into it.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IdentityPoolName | The identity pool name into which to add the imported accounts. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| ADAccountName | The Active Directory account name to be imported.<br>Active Directory accounts are accepted in the following formats: Fully qualified DN e.g. CN=MyComputer,OU=Computers,DC=MyDomain,DC=Com; UPN format e.g MyComputer@MyDomain.Com; Domain qualified e.g MyDomain\\MyComputer. | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | The unique identifier for the identity pool to which imported accounts are to be added. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| Password | The current password for the computer account. | false | false |  |
| SecurePassword | The current password for the account (provided in a Secure String class). | false | false |  |
| ADUserName | The username for an Active Directoy user account with Write Permissions. This parameter is only used in Cloud deployments. | false | false |  |
| ADPassword | The matching password for an Active Directoy user account with Write Permissions. This parameter is only used in Cloud deployments. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
