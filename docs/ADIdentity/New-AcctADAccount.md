## Syntax

New-AcctADAccount [-IdentityPoolName] <String> -Count <Int32> [-StartCount <Int32>] [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

New-AcctADAccount [-IdentityPoolName] <String> -ADAccountName <String[]> [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

New-AcctADAccount -IdentityPoolUid <Guid> -Count <Int32> [-StartCount <Int32>] [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

New-AcctADAccount -IdentityPoolUid <Guid> -ADAccountName <String[]> [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to create new AD computer accounts and register them in an already existing identity pool.

The accounts are created using the information stored in the identity pool. This provides the account name (via the Naming Scheme property and Start Count), domain, and OU.

The runspace used for this command must have sufficient privileges in Active Directory to create the new computer accounts.

The AD account names will pad the index to use all the space specified in the identity pool naming scheme (e.g. "acc###" will become "acc001"). However, if the index overflows the available space the cmdlet expands the format to use the next incremental number (e.g. "acc###" will become "acc1000" if the index is 10000, which cannot fit into the three '#' placeholders). If this expanded name exceeds the 15 character name limit, the accounts are not created.

There can be only one creation process running for a specific identity pool at any one time. Attempting to start another account creation process while an existing one is executing results in an error being returned.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IdentityPoolName | The name of the identity pool in which to create the accounts. | true | false |  |
| Count | The number of accounts to create. | true | false |  |
| ADAccountName | The AD account names to be created.  These are just the simple machine account names e.g. MyVM001 | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | The unique identifier for the identity pool in which the accounts will be created. | true | false |  |
| StartCount | The start index for the create process. | false | false |  |
| ADUserName | The username for an Active Directoy user account with Write Permissions. This parameter is only used in Cloud deployments. | false | false |  |
| ADPassword | The matching password for an Active Directoy user account with Write Permissions. This parameter is only used in Cloud deployments. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
